       <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>

       <p>
         Grid based design is The Renaissance artists of 15th and 16th Centuries used divine proportion to create their paintings, architecture or sculptures. In the similar fashion the designers today use this ratio while developing posters, layouts and brochures. Designers are of the opinion that instead of relying simply on artistic ideas, divine proportion is more useful in giving logical guidelines for developing layouts which are not only attractive but has unique appeal. One way to apply grid based design is by splitting your designs into a row the full length of the screen width, and 12 columns using percentages so they can stay in proportion on different sized screens. 12 columns is the perfect number to break up into two, three or four columns.

      <h4> Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>

      <p>
        Responsive webpages are pretty hyped up, as we access web pages on many different devices and screens including smart phones, tablets, lap tops and desktops. Having a responsive page is really important for the user experience, so they can access an aesthetically pleasing design and page no matter which device they're using. One of the parts I benefitted from the most in the Udacity tutorial was the @ media tags, so your site can be responsive to the screen size its displayed on.

      <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>

    <p>
      Creating a web page with semantic structure has long been considered a best practice because it gives the web page more meaning. In HTML4 and XHTML, web designers can create a semantic structure by following well-established rules with HTML tags.

    </p>

      <p>
        For example, the most important headline on a page should be formatted with the Heading 1, or <h1> tag. Similarly, most web designers now define class or ID styles for the main sections of a site with names like header and footer to identify their role and importance on a page.
        </p>

        <p>
          HTML5 takes this concept a step further by adding a series of new semantic elements. Rather than create a class or ID style and apply it to a <div> tag, in HTML5 you can simply use tags with names like <header> and <footer>.

          </p>

<p>
  Thus, rather than use ID styles such as <div id=”nav”>, you can simply use <nav>. Much like <div> tags, however, none of the new tags does anything unless you define a set of style rules that correspond to the name.
  </p>

<p>
  Building these semantic elements into HTML5 gives designers a more consistent way of structuring HTML pages and is recommended because it makes web pages more accessible for anyone who uses a screen reader to read web pages aloud, as well as for search bots and other programs that need to interpret the content of a web page irrespective of its design.
</p>


<p>
  Think of it this way: When you see a web page, you can generally tell by the design which part of the page is the header (it has the navigation area with links) and which is the footer (with the copyright and other details). But none of the bots, readers, and other programs that need to interpret web pages can “see” the design, and that’s part of the reason that using semantics is important.

</p>

  <p>

    The semantic structure of a page can be independent from the styling and positioning of the content, so you can create a page that has meaning because recognizable sections make up a logical structure. For your visitors who can see the page, you can style sections, such as the header or footer, to display any way you want them to in a browser.


    </p>

    <h4>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h4>

    <p>
      I haven't seen the next tutorial on Bootstrap, but that looks very interesting. Some parts of CSS remind me of maths/algebra, especially giving columns percentages and the structure of writing it reminds me of algebra equations. Random thought! I also really enjoyed the kitten and puppy place holders, that you can give your required dimenions and it gives a perfect sized kitten/puppy photo to use as a place holder. I will definately be looking to incorporate those where possible.
