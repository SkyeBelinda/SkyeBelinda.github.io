       <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>
       <p>Grid based design is The Renaissance artists of 15th and 16th Centuries used divine proportion to create their paintings, architecture or sculptures. In the similar fashion the designers today use this ratio while developing posters, layouts and brochures. Designers are of the opinion that instead of relying simply on artistic ideas, divine proportion is more useful in giving logical guidelines for developing layouts which are not only attractive but has unique appeal. One way to apply grid based design is by splitting your designs into a row the full length of the screen width, and 12 columns using percentages so they can stay in proportion on different sized screens. 12 columns is the perfect number to break up into two, three or four columns. </p>


      <h4> Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>
      <p>Responsive webpages are pretty hyped up, as we access web pages on many different devices and screens including smart phones, tablets, lap tops and desktops. Having a responsive page is really important for the user experience, so they can access an aesthetically pleasing design and page no matter which device they're using. One of the parts I benefitted from the most in the Udacity tutorial was the @ media tags, so your site can be responsive to the screen size its displayed on. </p>


      <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>
    <p>
      Creating a web page with semantic structure has long been considered a best practice because it gives the web page more meaning. In HTML4 and XHTML, web designers can create a semantic structure by following well-established rules with HTML tags.</p>

      <p>The semantic structure of a page can be independent from the styling and positioning of the content, so you can create a page that has meaning because recognizable sections make up a logical structure. For your visitors who can see the page, you can style sections, such as the header or footer, to display any way you want them to in a browser.</p>

    <h4>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h4>

    <p>I haven't seen the next tutorial on Bootstrap, but that looks very interesting. Some parts of CSS remind me of maths/algebra, especially giving columns percentages and the structure of writing it reminds me of algebra equations. Random thought! I also really enjoyed the kitten and puppy place holders, that you can give your required dimenions and it gives a perfect sized kitten/puppy photo to use as a place holder. I will definately be looking to incorporate those where possible. </p>
