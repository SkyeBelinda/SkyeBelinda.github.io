    <h1>Udacity Reflection</h1>
    <h2>HTML, CSS and the DOM <em>Boxifying Design</em> Box Model </h2>
    <h3>19th July 2017 </h3>


       <h4>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h4>
       <p>The analogy that Udacity used was a house. If HTML is the walls, CSS is the colour and decorations in the house, and the DOM is the functionality, like the garage door opening.
    </p>

      <h4>What is meant by boxifying design?</h4>
      <p>Boxifying design is breaking a design down into boxes. According to Udacity, everything on the web is a box, and by breaking it down into smaller boxes you can explore different ways the design can fit together. The example shown was a print out of a webpage, physically cut up into smaller boxes, to explore other ways ot could be layed out. </p>


      <h4>What is the box model?</h4>
    <p>
      The box model is the text/content, the padding, the container/border, and the margin. It looks like a box within a box within a box within a box. The box model is how you can change and give values to each container or box, which can change the lay out and feel of a page.
