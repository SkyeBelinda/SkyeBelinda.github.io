 <h1>Self Confidence, Chapter Four</h1>
 <h2>Learnings from 'Search Inside Yourself' by Chade-Meng Tan</h2>
 <h3>6th August 2017 </h3>

 <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness? </h4>

 <p>
   Mindfulness is our focussed awareness but with the judgement taken out of it, through a gentle acceptance of allowing everything we see, feel and experience to be just as it is.
 </p>

<p>
  So for example we could be aware that we are angry but still get caught up in the emotion and act out that anger. With mindfulness we might see the anger, attempt to not judge it and let it be just exactly as it is.

 </p>

 <p>
   Mindfulness could be seen as helping us on our path to self awareness. As we study ourselves, we become more and more self-aware. This is the key to improving decision-making; to make choices that are in alignment with what we want to create in our lives.
 </p>

 <h4>
   Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
 </h4>

  <p>
    I tried the body scanning, and found it was really good to allow my focus and energy be directed towards how my body is feeling and why. Today I played soccer in the rain and wind, and didn't notice it at the time, but from doing the body scanning later today I could feel both my calf muscles were cramping alot, and my right ankle was a bit sore. It was good to be aware of the different regions of my body, and allow myself to experience how each part feels, without trying to change anything.
  </p>

  <h4>
    What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
  </h4>

  <p>
    I took away the idea that its really beneficial to be able to recognize your emotions as a current state you are in, without recognizing them as being part of your identity. The "I feel" instead of "I am " idea.
