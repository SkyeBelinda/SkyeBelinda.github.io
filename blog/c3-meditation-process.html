  <h1>Meditation Process</h1>

  <h2>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h2>

  <p>I liked that there was a concept around process over product as it took some of the pressure off having a great product, and let me focus on learning the process invloved. I wasn't tempted to rely completely on a framework as I was happy to work through what I needed to. However I think it may have also resulted in my site not really being a great product at the end, with lots of room for improvement. </p>

  <h2>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h2>

  <p>Before meditation I thought it was the part at the end of a yoga class. I hadn't really tried meditation on its own before, and any efforts to seemed to just result in my mind wandering and not really getting into a meditative state.</p>

  <h2>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h2>

  <p>I've learnt that meditation can play a big part in emotional intelligence and self awareness, and by being well trained in meditative practice you can then use it in adverse or tense situations to react in the best possible way. </p>

  <h2>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h2>

  <p> One of the techniques that stood out to me was that you can do walking meditative practice. I love going for walks down by the river to take a break from work, and after listening to the audio book explain how you can practice meditation techniques while walking I began to realise there are times that I am practicing meditation without realising it. </p>

  <h2>Any other musings?<h2>

    <p>I find it quite hard not to start day dreaming and drifting off when meditation, I think I enjoy guided meditation a but better as it gives my mind something to focus on and somewhere to direct my thoughts / energy. </p>
