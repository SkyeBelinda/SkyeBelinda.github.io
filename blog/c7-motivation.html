<h2>Learnings from 'Search Inside Yourself' by Chade-Meng Tan</h2>
<h3>27th August 2017 </h3>


<h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>

<p>
  Pleasure, passion and purpose are the three 'P's of happiness. Pleasure is described as the 'rockstar life', always chasing the next high. science has shown that out of the three types of happiness this is the most fleeting and short lasting and “as soon as the source of stimuli goes away, people’s happiness drops immediately”.
</p>

<p>
  Passion is sometimes descibed as being in a state of 'flow' or 'in the zone'. Being in one of these states is where peak performance meets peak engagement, and you can easily look track of time as you're so absorbed and involved.
</p>

<p>
  The higher-purpose type of happiness is about being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you. Research has shown that of the three types of happiness, this is the longest lasting. It is the teamwork and feeling of “oneness” that you feel with your partner, friend, family, community and coworkers.
</p>


<p>
  Based on the findings of the research, the proper strategy would be to figure out and pursue the higher purpose first (since it is the longest-lasting type of happiness), then layer on top of that passion, and then add on top of that the pleasure type of happiness.
</p>


<h4>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,
What are your core values? What do you stand for?</h4>

<p>
  I am still in the process of completing working out my core values and what I stand for. I think some of my core values include family, friends, independence, nature, envoronmental awareness, well-being, knowledge, personal and professional growth, culture and communication. I think taking time to consider what your core values and what you stand for is a valuable task though.
</p>




<h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>

<p>
  I enjoyed the resliance ideas and meditation excercise. It was interesting to hear how big a role perception plays in resiliance, and how we can either percieve stress in our lives as major set backs or moments of growth.
</p>

  <p>
    Most of life’s stressors are subjective and with mindfulness (seeing things as they are in this present moment), we have the ability to respond with wisdom vs. react in a harmful way. When we see our thoughts and feelings clearly and can offer compassion for the hardship we are experiencing, we increase our resilience.
