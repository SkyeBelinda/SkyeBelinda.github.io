       <h4> What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>

       <p>
         I ended up downloading the book on audible and listening to the whole book while at work/ driving. Some of the main learnings I took were self awareness and empathy are really important and it helped me connect the dots on how mindfulness can help with emotional intelligence (by being aware of your body). The chapter also made the point that our emotional intelligence is not fixed, and can be learned and developed with practice.

       <p>
         Emotional Intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions. It is one of the best predictors of success at work and fulfillment in life. Its benefits include:
         Stellar work performance,
         Outstanding leadership,
         The ability to create the conditions for happiness.
       </p>



      <h4> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>

      <p>
      I enjoyed the two minutes of mindfulness, it reminded me of the end of a yoga class, where you focus on your breathing and letting go. I was listening to the book while driving through traffic in town, and I normally get a bit frustrated with the red lights etc, I found listening to the book and practising mindfulness while doing that really helpful in allowing me to return to a calm state and recognize feelings/frustrations that were occuring.

    <p>
      When living in mindfulness, neutral activities tend to become pleasant, and pleasant experiences become even more pleasant.
