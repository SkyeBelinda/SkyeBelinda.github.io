     <h1>Daily Mindfulness</h1>
     <h2>Learnings from 'Search Inside Yourself' by Chade-Meng Tan</h2>
     <h3>6th August 2017 </h3>

     <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it? </h4>

     <p>
       I learn form the mindfulness conversation that I often interupt or try and guess what the other person is saying, and I'm often over eager to try and add in my own but to the conversation. It actually took more control than I would have initially thought to not interupt and give my full undivded attention to letting the other person talk, and give them space to say everything they wanted in their own way without me trying to jump in and add more. The other person enjoyed having my undivded attention and also enjoyed being able to fully gather and articulate their thoughts fully.
     </p>

     <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>

     <p>
       I'll use body scan meditation to sustain my practice. This will involve building body awareness. Some of the benefits are to ease tension after a long day or before falling asleep at night.A body scan meditation allows us to identify where unconscious holding patterns reside and helps to release them with our own awareness, enabling us to relax more completely.
