    <h1>The Story of Time</h1>
    <h2>As sand runs through the hour glass so does the time in our lives <em> Habbits </em> And time </h2>
    <h3> 15th July 2017 </h3>

    <p>
      Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? The growth mindset and
what did you find interesting? I found the growth mindset interesting as it drew links to someone going to the gym / working out. I enjoy expercise and sports and have clearly seen how your abilities can change and grow if you work hard at it. I think if you view your brain as being like just another muscle in your body that you can excercise and grow by exposing it to new learnings and practicising and reflecting on these learnings it can be easy to have the growth mindset. </p>

what worked for you? It worked for me to think of confidence as displayed ability. By mastering many small tasks, and letting my confidence grow. <p>

Which will you experiment further with?
The pomodoro technique - 25 minute blocks -  seeing how many pomodoro's tasks will take. Being more efficient and improving the quality of my work will be some of my focuses to experiment with. I also like that the pomodoro technique eliminates pushing yourself too hard, and enabling better work/life balance so you know you've been productive in the day and can actually enjoy your free time. <p/>
