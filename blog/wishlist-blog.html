    <div<p>I like the bold block colours and layout of this page. The subtle grey background pictures are nice too. I'd like to use some of these features on my page. </p>

  <div<p>The georgia sans-serif font is a feature I'd like to include, along with the side bar links.</p>

  </div>

  <br><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/123/">Zen Garden 123</a></br>

  <div<p>The main feature I'd incorporate from this page is the flowers at the top. </p>

  <div<p>This page is easy to read and seems to fit the page well, it doesnt feel cluttered at all. The use of the green makes it feel fresh and light. The features I'd like to incorporate from this page are the overall layout, the font, and the spacing, and the navigation bar on the right and down the side.</p></div>

  <br><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/220/">Zen Garden 220</a></br>

  <div<p>The text moving up and down while the background stays the same is a feature I'd like to use from this page.</p></div>
