       <h4>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</h4>

       <p>A responsive site is one that responds its layout and contents in relation to the size of screen it's displayed on. Responsiveness is important as webpages are not just viewed on desktop sized screens. They are also viewed on laptops, lablets, phones, and the screen sizes in all of these varies alot aswell. Responsiveness is important for the usability and exoerience people have when viewing sites. For examle having a mobile responsive site may mean your site is scaled down, and only has the most important text/content/links on it so the user does not have to scroll or zoom in alot to find what they are looking for.

       </p>


      <h4> What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h4>

      <p> Mobile first design relates to CSS and giving conditions/instructions for a mobile sized screen first. This is because there is likely going to be alot less styling/code needed for the mobile, so it makes sense to have the code for that first, and then build upon it / add more code/instructions for bigger screen sizes second.

      </p>


      <h4>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h4>

    <p>Pros of a framework include allowing you to build a site faster and easier. It can be alot more efficient to then writing hundreds of lines of code yourself. Security is another pro - because frameworks are widely used any holes in security get noticed promptly and there is a team who are dedicated to fixing it. Cost is another pro, with it generally being free to use a framework, and support is another pro as they usually come with a support team and have community forums for help.


    </p>


    <h4> What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h4>

    <p>
      A Wireframe is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. Wireframes are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose.Wireframes help make the design process iterative. Instead of trying to combine the functionality/layout and creative/branding aspects of the website in one step, wireframes ensure that these elements are taken in one at a time. This allows clients (and other team members) to provide feedback earlier in the process.

    </ul>


    <h4> The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</h4>

    <p>I've found properly mastering the 'boxifying design' more challenging then I thought I would at first. Also getting the Nav bar where and how I want it looking has been a challenge. I'm still getting a handle on the CSS and the media queries, when I watch the tutorials it looks really easy, but am still figuring out the most effective way to incorporate it into mine. The rem and em size was an interesting discovery aswell and am still becoming familiar with the scale of these and what works best with mobile size versus laptop size.
