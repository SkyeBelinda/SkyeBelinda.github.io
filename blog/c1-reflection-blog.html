    <h1>The Story of Reflecting</h1>
    <h2>Skye's take on the EDA experience <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</em> Impressions</h2>
    <h3>15th July 2017</h3>

    <p What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience? <b>
      My take is that it's an excelarated learning experience that focuses on enabling students to develop the basic skills needed to get their first job as a developer. With a focus on developing technical skills and abilities, there is also an equal emphasis on engineering empathy and soft skills needed for web developers. From attending the 'day in the life' at EDA I enjoyed hearing about their values and views on education; and how when learning new skills all sides of a person (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual) are dynamic and work together and are influencing the process of learning. I'm a qualified Primary School teacher and when doing my teacher training this view of education and learning being influenced by the whole self reminded me of Maori culture views on education and embracing all assets all of someones Hauora (well-being) including spiritual, emotional, physical, mental in comparison to a western/modern view of education which can tend to compartmentalize individuals and not cater to all of their needs.

      What are your impressions?
      My impression so far are positive, I like the space on Cuba Street, I was not sure how well I would cope with remote learning but so far have found there is alot of support if and when you need it while working remotely.

   How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
      I see myself engaging positively in this type of culture. I enjoy learning new skills and having a safe and calm environment to learn in is so important and I believe EDA has endevoured to set this up effectively. <p>

  Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
      Its only been less than a week so my expectations haven't changed too much so far.

    </p>

    Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? I'm nervous and excited to participate in this environment. It makes me nervous that I will be lacking in technical knowledge but excited to learn more.
