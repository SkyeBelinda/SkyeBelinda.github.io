<h4>
  When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?
</h4>

<p>
I think sometimes I am just not on a good place to begin learning. I maybe have other factors like work/life stresses that mean I may have a disproportinate emotional response to programming.
</p>

<p>
  I think some of my triggers may be that I am tired or have already been working too long on a problem. A trigger can be when I feel certain I have the correct code/solution but continue to get error messages. Or when I am not able to decipher what the error message is, or search on google and am not able to find the information I need. It is really satisfing though when you've been working on code/ a problem for a long time and then finally find the solution its a mixture of relief and joy and sometimes a little regret that you didn't find it earlier.
</p>


<h4>
  How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?
</h4>

<p>
  I really enjoyed the Siberian North exercise, it was really beneficial to slow things down and give yourself time to think about how to respond before having a quick impulsive reaction.
